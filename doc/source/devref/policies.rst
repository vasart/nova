Development policies
--------------------

Out Of Tree Support
===================

While nova has many entrypoints and other places in the code that allow for
wiring in out of tree code. Upstream doesn't actively make any guarantees
about these extensibility points; we don't support them, make any guarantees
about compatibility, stability, etc.

APIs
=====

Follow the guidelines set in: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/APIChangeGuidelines

The canonical source for API behavior is the code *not* documentation.
Documentation is manually generated after the code by folks looking at the
code and writing up what they think it does, and it is very easy to get
this wrong.

This policy is in place to prevent us from making backwards incompatible
changes to APIs.
